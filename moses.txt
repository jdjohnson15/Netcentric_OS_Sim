	JOEY: Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doing?
This is a poker game. You can't serve food with more than one syllable.
It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or pretz... [sudden realization]

	PHOEBE: Hey you guys, look, the one-eyed Jack follows me wherever I go.
Right, OK, serious poker. You guys, you know what I just realized?
'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J'. Coincidence?

	CHANDLER : Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!

	ROSS: So. You gals wanna hand over your money now?
That way, we don't have to go through the formality of actually playing.

	MONICA: You know what? This is not over. We will play you again,
and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take
every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever.

	RACHEL: Well, well, well, hop back in bucko, cause I got four sixes!
I won! I actually won! Y'know what? I think I'm gonna make a little
Ross pile. I think that one was Ross's, and I think--oh--that one
was Ross's. Yes!
